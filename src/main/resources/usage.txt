Usage: ${launchstring} -h
       ${launchstring} -l
       ${launchstring} [-v] -r PID
       ${launchstring} [-v] [-s] [-S PATTERNS-FILE-DST] [-f PATTERNS-FILE-SRC] [-m METHOD-ARGUMENT-DUMP-LIMIT] [PID] [CLASS-MATCHING-PATTERN [METHOD-MATCHING-PATTERN]]
	-h - print this help
	-l - list active Java processes which metracer could connect to
	-v - enables verbose output of what is going on (useful for troubleshoting)
	-r - remove all previous instrumentation in target JVM
	-s - print stack trace for each entry event
	-S - print stack trace for each entry event and additionally dump stack trace into PATTERNS-FILE-DST
	-f - load patterns from PATTERNS-FILE-SRC
	-m - max length of a dump of a method argument (defaults to 32)
	PID - PID of a Java program (target JVM) to attach to. Can be omitted - in this case autodiscovery of JVM will take place
	CLASS-MATCHING-PATTERN - a regex to decide for which classes tracing must be added
	METHOD-MATCHING-PATTERN - a regex to decide which methods must be traced; if not specified then all methods of a matching classes will be traced
